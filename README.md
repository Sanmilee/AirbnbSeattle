### Installation
The code would require any version of Python 3, numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries


### Project Motivation
For this project, I was intersected in the Seattle Airbnb Open Data for analyzing tourists’ activities in the city:
1. The property preference of most Airbnb subscribers in the region (houses, apartments, cabin, bungalow) . 
2. People’s choice of community in the Seattle region.
3. A study of respondents’ rating score based on their past experiences in the area.
4. How the respondents’ rating could affect future tourist activities in the city.](project-motivation)


### File Descriptions
There are 2 files in here, a csv data containing information of Airbnb subscribers in the Seattle, Washington region. The data is provided by Airbnb and Kaggle. Also, there is a jupyter notebook containing the analysis of our findings in the data. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here.](https://medium.com/@oluwasanmiariyo/destination-selection-in-seattle-washington-ef89ceabef0d)
